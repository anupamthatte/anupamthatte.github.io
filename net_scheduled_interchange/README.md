# Net Scheduled Interchange (NSI) Analysis

The Eastern Interconnection is one of the two major electrical grids in the continental U.S. It spans an area from the Rockies to the East coast (and extends into Canada). This grid is divided into several jurisdictions depending on who is responsible for its reliable operation. In some portions of this grid organizations called Regional Transmission Organizations (RTOs)  carry out that function [1]. Neighboring RTOs exchange electrical power with each other to ensure the reliable and efficient operation of the grid. The sum of MW import and export schedules is known as Net Scheduled Interchange (NSI). Understanding the patterns in the amounts of NSI can help to improve the efficiency of the RTO.

To conduct this analysis the dataset is obtained from the website of the Midcontinent ISO (MISO).
